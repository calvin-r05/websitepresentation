            <p>The Horse Chestnut tree is a large deciduous tree that is common in Ireland, known for the 
                conkers that fall off of it. A tree that Irish people are very familiar with, the Horse Chestnut is not actually a native species. Originally grown across eastern and southern Europe - from the Balkans to Greece, Albania and Bulgaria - the species is now endangered within its own habitat in the wild.

                Grown as an ornamental tree in Ireland for the past 200 years, it's most commonly found in woodlands and hedgerows, and generally reaches up to 36 metres in height. The tree grows into a domed collection of thick branches, which are covered with brown buds. In Spring, these flower into white flowers with pink or yellow spots before spiky fruits known as chestnuts or conkers develop in the Autumn and fall to the ground.
                
                Conkers were once widely used as horse feed</p>
